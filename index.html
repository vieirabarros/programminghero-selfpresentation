            <h1>Big <span class="purple-color"></span>Dream</h1>
            <h3>Becoming a web developer</h3>
            <p>
                Right now I'm brushing my web development fundamentals skills (HTML, CSS, JS, Git).
                And I still don't have a clear path between front-end and back-end, the two paths are incredibly interesting.
                But I'll probably go with front-end development with React.js, as it's the front-end framework that we use in my current job, so It's the most practical path.
